<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been working on computers since I was a little kid. My family got our first Windows 95 computer when I was about 8
  and I immediately got obsessed with it. I quickly became our family's tech person. Any problems with the computer I was able
  to solve.

<p>I got my first taste of working with code when I was about 12 got a cheat device for my Nintendo DS called an Action Replay. The Action
  replay used Hexidecimal values to edit the the coding of the game to give you advantages like unlimited health or to change
  the stats of your characters. My computer did not meet the minimum specs to run the software that uploads the cheats from a database
  on the computer, so I had to manually type out lines and lines of Hexidecimal values to use the cheats. I also decided to learn how to
  write my name in binary and how to write numbers and stuff. There was a lot of math involved so it didn't really stick, but I still
  thought it was very interesting.

<p>I have never encountered a problem on my computer that I have not been able to solve using my own research, from replacing parts, rebuilding
  my computer, to removing viruses manually using critical thinking and the best resource: Google.

  Recently I got the itch to learn how to code and took my first life changing steps towards tech: taking a course on learning how to code in Python.
  Since then all of my spare time has been dedicated towards my newest obsession: building games and programs using python and learning Web Development</p>
