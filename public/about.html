  <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
<p>I have been working on computers since I was a little kid. My family got our first Windows 95 computer <br />when I was about 8
  and I immediately got obsessed with it. I quickly became our family's tech person. Any problems with the computer I was able
  to solve.
</p>

<p>I got my first taste of working with code when I was about 12 got a cheat device for my Nintendo DS called<br /> an Action Replay. The Action
  replay used Hexidecimal values to edit the the coding of the game to give you advantages like unlimited health <br />or to change
  the stats of your characters. My computer did not meet the minimum specs to run the software that uploads the<br /> cheats from a database
  on the computer, so I had to manually type out lines and lines of Hexidecimal values to use the cheats.<br /> I also decided to learn how to
  write my name in binary and how to write numbers and stuff. There was a lot of math involved so it didn't <br /> really stick, but I still
  thought it was very interesting.
</p>

<p>I have never encountered a problem on my computer that I have not been able to solve using my own research,<br /> from replacing parts, rebuilding
  my computer, to removing viruses manually using critical thinking and the best resource: <br />Google.
</p>

<p>
  Recently I got the itch to learn how to code and took my first life changing steps towards tech: taking a course on <br />learning how to code in Python.
  Since then all of my spare time has been dedicated towards my newest obsession: building games and programs using python and learning <br />Web Development</p>
